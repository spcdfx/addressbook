# Address Book
Small Address Book application I created as a project.

Here is my Address Book application created using PHP and MySQL.

To create a database with the correct infomation used in the application please find the sql import information in the file named **'contactsexport.txt'**

To connect to your database please edit the values found in **'public/php/dbloginvalues.php'** to allow the application to access the database.

The only feature my application is currently missing is the edit contact feature due to issues with importing values from the database into editable inputs. I am still making changes to the application to hopefully have a working edit feature soon.
